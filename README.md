This is a demo project to try out TensorFlow.js. It features a simple website
that learns to track your eye movement in the browser.

## How to use

Just open index.html. Allow using the webcam. Now follow the red ball on screen
and click space whenever you're focused on it. Repeat at least 5-10 times.

Now hit enter. The model will train for a bit. When it's done, the green ball
will try to follow your eye movement.

It will be very bad at first. So keep following the red ball and hitting space
to collect more training data. Hit enter whenever you feel like you have enough
to keep training.
